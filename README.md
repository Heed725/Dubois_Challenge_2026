# #DuBoisChallenge2026

My entries for the **2026 W.E.B. Du Bois Data Visualization Challenge**, organized by [Anthony Starks](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge/2026).

## About the Challenge

A goal of Du Bois's exhibition in 1900 was to demonstrate the development of Black Americans since emancipation in 1865. One hundred and twenty-six years later, in 2026, this year's challenge focuses on the use of **maps and geography** in the collection — recreating Du Bois's cartographic plates using modern tools.

Each challenge has its own directory in this repository, including the original visual and associated data. Challenge directories contain data as **CSV files**, and geographic data as both **GeoJSON** and **shapefiles**.

## Challenges

### Challenge 01 — Plate 01 · February 9
*"The Georgia Negro, A Social Study"* shows the transatlantic slave trade, with routes from Europe, Africa, the Americas, and the Caribbean, highlighting Georgia. This visual contains Du Bois's famous assertion: *"The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line."*

### Challenge 02 — Plate 02 · February 16
A map of the US showing the distribution of Black people at the turn of the twentieth century, ranging from 75,000 and over in Georgia to less than 10,000 in the western states.

### Challenge 03 — Plate 05 · February 23
A choropleth showing the Black population in Georgia counties, ranging from over 30,000 in the south east to under 1,000 in the north and southern portions of the state. The most prevalent category is 5–10,000 people distributed throughout the state.

### Challenge 04 — Plate 06 · March 2
A choropleth map with an alternating left-right pattern comparing the population of Black Georgians in 1870 and 1880. The map shows a decrease of lightly populated areas, with the heavily populated areas in red shifting west.

### Challenge 05 — Plate 08 · March 9
Migration to and from Georgia to other states of the US. The map shows how the state with a large Black population originated and where they were dispersed to.

### Challenge 06 — Plate 20 · March 16
A choropleth of the state of Georgia depicting land ownership by Black Americans from 1870 to 1900, used as an indicator of economic and social development.

### Challenge 07 — Plate 37 · March 23
The introductory display of the exhibition, featuring the full Du Bois color palette, bi-lingual text, a map of the Black population in the US, and a pie chart showing professions in the population.

### Challenge 08 — Plate 38 · March 30
The distribution of Black Americans in the United States measured by number of people per square mile — ranging from 15–45 in southern states like Georgia and Mississippi, to less than 1 person per square mile in the west and upper midwest.

### Challenge 09 — Plate 41 · April 6
A small multiples chart comparing the population of Black Americans with various countries: Spain, Australia, Norway/Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Hungary, Bavaria, and England.

### Challenge 10 — Plate 42 · April 13
The proportion of Black Americans in the total US population compared from 1800 (one-fifth, 20%) to 1890 (one-eighth, 12.5%), shown as superimposed maps — a land within another land.
